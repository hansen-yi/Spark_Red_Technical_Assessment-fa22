1. The intended functionality of this program was that it was supposed to allow the user to input a starting location, a destination, and locations that the user wanted to stop by in the middle and it would return the most optimal path timewise using information from Google Maps. 
2. I really don't have many features, I would say I have Classes and objects and not exactly a database but an attempt at integration with something like a database by parsing Google Maps.
3. I spent probably around 6-7 hours just because of the bugs that I kept running into, in addition, to refreshing myself on graph alogorithms and how to implement them properly.
4. Probably the easist way would be to download the files, but it really does not do much. Thr Program.java file has a Scanner that allows for user input through the console however with the Google Maps parsing not working correctly since JSoup can't parse websites' javascript so I was unable to add that functionality, running the program does not do much unless you manually write example cases. I will attempt to fix this but I don't really have much time before the deadline. If I do manage to fix it, I have included the JSoup jar file as well for parsing to work correctly.
